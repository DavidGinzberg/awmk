title: Measuring Productivity
---

There's a question that I wonder about fairly frequently: "How do you know you're being productive?" or, the slightly more granular "How do you know how productive you are being?"  
To date I haven't found one right answer to either of these, but I've learned about a few nice tools for productivity, as well as some of the enemies of productivity, such as multitasking and distraction. As an extremely distractable individual (this post is the result of me being distracted) who frequently tries to do multiple things at once, I have to work pretty hard to stay on task and to keep track of what I have to do/have already done. There are three key habits I try to foster in order to accomplish this:  
- Make lists
  - todo lists
  - shopping lists
  - lists of lists (*ahem*)
  - [Franz Liszt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Liszt) - er...nevermind
- Write stuff down 
  - Contact info
  - important dates
  - hairbrained ideas
  - anything and everything; if it's worth wondering if you should write it down, you should write it down.
- Tracking time spent doing certain things (including sleep; more on that in another post/blog)

I've been using [Trello](https://trello.com/davidginzberg/recommend)[^TrelloDisclosure] and [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/) for lists, and I almost always have a [Field Notes](http://fieldnotesbrand.com/) or [Moleskine](http://www.moleskine.com/) notebook handy, or at least a slip of paper, but it's that last list item that I want to write about today. I had a [brief Twitter conversation](https://twitter.com/rescuetime/status/562700515847712768) with the folks at [Rescue Time] today, an application I use to keep track of how I'm spending my time, and it got me thinking again about how to measure when you are being productive and when you aren't.

I'm certainly not an expert on how Rescue Time works, given that I only use the free version and I really only do so passively, but what I do know is that it categorizes the applications you use and pages you visit, and uses those categories and rankings you've provided to rank them on a 5-level scale from highly unproductive to highly productive. This information is aggregated and provided on a dashboard.  
While this is a huge step in the right direction, it has its flaws. Some distractions are not always distractions, particularly those that have to do with communication. As I mentioned in our twitter conversation, I use multiple applicaitons for communicating with my colleagues
