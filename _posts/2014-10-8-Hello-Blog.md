title: Hello Blog
---

Say "hello" to Arguing With My Keyboard! This is a technology-focused blog I have tried to start a few times, but always got caught up with work or configuration issues and let the blog fall by the wayside.

This time I'm rebooting it using the Jekyll Now template [available on github](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). It's very simple and hopefully will make posting to and maintaining this blog a bit easier. Watch here for the first few posts in the coming weeks!
